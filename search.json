You can do this using software like R. The files you need are named cats_uk.csv and cats_uk_reference.csv.\nView the Data: After reading the data, use a tool or function (like the View function in R) to visually inspect the contents of both data files. This step helps you understand what’s in the data.\nLoad Libraries: Make sure you have certain software libraries installed and loaded. These libraries include dplyr, move, moveVis, maptools, magrittr, and ggplot2. They provide tools for data manipulation and visualization.\nCombine and Filter Data: Use the dplyr library to combine the data from the two CSV files based on a common column called “tag_id.” After combining, filter the data to select only specific cat names like “Bear,” “Coco,” etc.\nConvert Timestamps: Convert the timestamps in the filtered data from a text format to a date-time format. This makes it easier to work with time-based data.\nCreate a Move Object: Using the filtered and timestamp-converted data, create a “move object” that represents the movement of cats. This object specifies the columns for longitude, latitude, time, and track ID.\nAlign Data: Adjust the timestamps in the move object to align them at a specific resolution, such as daily intervals. This step aggregates the data for each day.\nGenerate Map Frames: Create map frames to visualize cat movements. You can customize these frames by adding things like labels, a north arrow, and a scale bar.\nAdd Text: Include text on the map frames, such as a Twitter handle, at a specific location.\nPreview a Frame: Optionally, you can preview one of the map frames to see how it looks.\nGenerate an Animation: Finally, use a function or tool (like animate_frames) to turn the map frames into an animated GIF. This GIF will show the movements of the selected cats over time."

In this session, we will talk about virtual environments such as venv or Anaconda, and container systems such as Docker or Podman, to tackle libraries management for any programming languages (Python, R, Haskell, C, etc). This special edition of the Programming cafe is hosted at the Faculty of Science, but open for everyone!

For some of these topics, we’ve also added additional challenges!\n\nExercise1 SimpleCommit\nLearn about git’s internals by inspecting a commit under the hood.\n\nAdditional exercises\n\nCreate a subdirectory subdir and create a file hello2.txt in it, with content such as Hello to you too!.\nCommit subdir/hello2.txt\n\nNow, using at most the following three commands, can you output the contents of the file you just committed, hello2.txt?\n\ngit log\ngit ls-tree\ngit cat-file\n\n\n\n\nExercise2 Staging and Stashing\nExercise Two - Staging and Stashing\nLearn to exercise precise control over what is added to your commits, with git add -p and git stash.\n\nAdditional exercise\nCan you figure out how to use git stash to stash everything that is not staged for commit? (Hint: you’ll need to pass two options to git stash). Solution.\n\n\n\nExercise7 RebaseAndAmend\nExercise Seven - Rebase and Amend\n\nAdditional exercises\n\nThe exercise in the tutorial has you use git commit --amend to change a commit’s message. Can you also use amend to change the contents of the files within the commit?\nMost difficult: the exercise in the tutorial has you use rebase -i to squash some commits. This allows you to combine a number of commits that each contain too little to amount to an atomic commit into one. But suppose you have a commit in your history that contains too much to amount to an atomic commit – i.e. a commit that changes two logically distinct bits of code. How can you use rebase -i to split this commit into two atomic commits? (Hint: you’ll need more commands than just rebase). Solution.\nSimilarly, can you use rebase -i to completely delete an unwanted commit, as well?\nOops! You just deleted a commit and it’s all gone from your branch. This is one of the ways in which you could (accidentally) lose work while rebasing. But git wouldn’t be git if you couldn’t undo a rebase. Can you figure out how to restore your previous commit? Hint Solution\n\n\n\n\nExercise4 Merging and ReReRe\nExercise4 Merging and ReReRe\nReuse Recorded Resolution is a feature that lets you automate merge conflict resolution (for similar/recurring merge conflicts). This can be especially handy when rebasing, as rebasing can require you to solve the same merge conflict multiple times!\n\n\nExercise9 Advanced Tools\nExercise9 Advanced Tools\nNotes:\n\ncherry-pick can be very useful for creating atomic git histories. It essentially does the inverse of rebase: rather than replaying the changes on the current branch on top of (typically) main (rebase), it replays the changes from a commit on a different branch on top of the current branch. If your feature branch is a mess, but contains some commits that are nice atomic gems, you may be able to cherry-pick the latter on your main branch!\ngit bisect is a great debugging tool, especially when used in its automatic mode in conjunction with unit tests. Give the example here a go!"

It’s an attractive free alternative to Matlab and for users trained in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) rather than software development: the syntax is close to mathematical notation and the development of libraries for high-performance scientific computation is very active. Compared to Python, Julia’s reproducible environments system is designed to be moved between platforms more smoothly and reduce compatibility issues. But the main focus of Julia is high performance; although it can be used interactively (as scripts), it can be as fast - occasionally faster - than compiled languages such as Fortran."

High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms provide compute power that might help to speed up your calculations or to increase your problem size (e.g. simulations at finer resolution, or exploring more parameter combinations). In this Programming Cafe Lukas van de Wiel, scientific programmer in Earth Sciences, will introduce us in the concepts of writing parallel code for HPC. As always we will prepare some hands on exercises so you can practice writing some parallel code yourself!"

    "text": "Exercises\n\nPythonR\n\n\nThere are many ways to speed up your code in Python, and also many ways to parallelize your code. The Parallel Programming in Python course that is co-developed and taught by the eScience Center is a great way to learn more about this in more detail. Below is a notebook that will introduce you to the multiprocessing library in Python, and a link to some the course materials of the above course about dask.\n\n1. multiprocessing library\nDownload the notebook from the notebooks (link missing) folder and follow the instructions in the notebook.\n\n\n2. dask and profilers\nCheckout this cool tutorial on dask and measuring performance from the Parallel Programming in Python course (by the eScience Center).\n\n\nOptional:\nBrowse the Parallel Programming in Python course to see what other topics might be interesting for you, and feel free to try out some of the code examples.\n\n\n\nThere are different approaches to parallel programming in R. One package that can be used is the doFuture package in combination with the foreach package.\ninstall.packages(\"doFuture\")\ninstall.packages('foreach')\nFollow this tutorial on how to use this package and stop at the section Writing code that runs on multiple nodes.\nTry now to use the same method for doing some computations in parallel. For example:\nestimate_pi &lt;- function(N) {\n    j &lt;- 0\n    for (i in 1:N) {\n        x &lt;- runif(1,-1,1)\n        y &lt;- runif(1,-1,1)\n        if (x^2+y^2&lt; 1)  {\n            j=j+1\n        }\n    }\nreturn(4*j/N)\n}\nTip: There are two approaches: either parallelize the function, or run the function in parallel with batched inputs. Try both, think on forehand what would be the more useful approach and why and compare the results."
