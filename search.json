Use an action to help reduce the amount of repetitive code that you write in your workflow files.\n \nEvent\nAn event is a specific activity in a repository that triggers GitHub Actions to start. For example, activity can originate from GitHub when someone creates a pull request, opens an issue, or pushes a commit to a repository. You can also trigger GitHub Actions on a schedule."

We are borrowing from the #TidyTuesday initiative and we’ll analyzing data from Pet Cats UK.\nOnce you have gotten hold of the data, you can attempt to reproduce some of the example visualizations (beginner, intermediate, advanced) we’ve gathered. You can use whatever programming language you like and we encourage you to work in pairs/groups - so you can learn together!\nsource for much of the text/code below: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-01-31/readme.md\n\nPet Cats UK\nThe data this week comes from the Movebank for Animal Tracking Data via Data is Plural. Thanks @jthomasmock for the suggestion!\n\nBetween 2013 and 2017, Roland Kays et al. convinced hundreds of volunteers in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and New Zealand to strap GPS sensors on their pet cats. The aforelinked datasets include each cat’s characteristics (such as age, sex, neuter status, hunting habits) and time-stamped GPS pings.\n\n\nWhen using this dataset, please cite the original article.\n\n\nKays R, Dunn RR, Parsons AW, Mcdonald B, Perkins T, Powers S, Shell L, McDonald JL, Cole H, Kikillus H, Woods L, Tindle H, Roetman P (2020) The small home ranges and large local ecological impacts of pet cats.

If the data owner does not provide a tag ID, an internal Movebank tag identifier may sometimes be shown.\n\n\nevent_id\ndouble\nAn identifier for the set of values associated with each event, i.e. sensor measurement. A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank. If multiple measurements are included within a single row of a data file, they will share an event ID. If users import the same sensor measurement to Movebank multiple times, a separate event ID will be assigned to each.\n\n\nvisible\nlogical\nDetermines whether an event is visible on the Movebank map. Values are calculated automatically, with TRUE indicating the event has not been flagged as an outlier by algorithm_marked_outlier, import_marked_outlier or manually_marked_outlier, or that the user has overridden the results of these outlier attributes using manually_marked_valid = TRUE. Allowed values are TRUE or FALSE.\n\n\ntimestamp\ndouble\nThe date and time corresponding to a sensor measurement or an estimate derived from sensor measurements.\n\n\nlocation_long\ndouble\nThe geographic longitude of the location as estimated by the sensor.

Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it.\n\n\nground_speed\ndouble\nThe estimated ground speed provided by the sensor or calculated between consecutive locations. Units are reportedly m/s, which indicates that there is likely a problem with this data (either the units were reported erroneously or their is an issue with the sensor data).\n\n\nheight_above_ellipsoid\ndouble\nThe estimated height above the ellipsoid, typically estimated by the tag. Units: meters\n\n\nalgorithm_marked_outlier\nlogical\nIdentifies events marked as outliers using a user-selected filter algorithm in Movebank. Outliers have the value TRUE.\n\n\nmanually_marked_outlier\nlogical\nIdentifies events flagged manually as outliers, typically using the Event Editor in Movebank, and may also include outliers identified using other methods.
