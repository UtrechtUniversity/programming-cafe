The syntax of each line within a crontab file expects a cron expression made of five fields which represent the time to execute the command, followed by a shell command to execute.\n# ┌───────────── minute (0–59)\n# │ ┌───────────── hour (0–23)\n# │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1–31)\n# │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1–12)\n# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0–6) (Sunday to Saturday;\n# │ │ │ │ │                                   7 is also Sunday on some systems)\n# │ │ │ │ │\n# │ │ │ │ │\n# * * * * * &lt;command to execute&gt;\nHere is a written tutorial: https://itsfoss.com/cron-job/"

You can do this using software like R. The files you need are named cats_uk.csv and cats_uk_reference.csv.\nView the Data: After reading the data, use a tool or function (like the View function in R) to visually inspect the contents of both data files. This step helps you understand what’s in the data.\nLoad Libraries: Make sure you have certain software libraries installed and loaded. These libraries include dplyr, move, moveVis, maptools, magrittr, and ggplot2. They provide tools for data manipulation and visualization.\nCombine and Filter Data: Use the dplyr library to combine the data from the two CSV files based on a common column called “tag_id.” After combining, filter the data to select only specific cat names like “Bear,” “Coco,” etc.\nConvert Timestamps: Convert the timestamps in the filtered data from a text format to a date-time format. This makes it easier to work with time-based data.\nCreate a Move Object: Using the filtered and timestamp-converted data, create a “move object” that represents the movement of cats. This object specifies the columns for longitude, latitude, time, and track ID.\nAlign Data: Adjust the timestamps in the move object to align them at a specific resolution, such as daily intervals. This step aggregates the data for each day.\nGenerate Map Frames: Create map frames to visualize cat movements. You can customize these frames by adding things like labels, a north arrow, and a scale bar.\nAdd Text: Include text on the map frames, such as a Twitter handle, at a specific location.\nPreview a Frame: Optionally, you can preview one of the map frames to see how it looks.\nGenerate an Animation: Finally, use a function or tool (like animate_frames) to turn the map frames into an animated GIF. This GIF will show the movements of the selected cats over time."
