## Why Git and GitHub?

## Why Git and GitHub?
<br>
Do you need to:

::: {.incremental}
-   backup your code?
-   better version control your code?
-   collaborate more easily?
-   share and publish your code?
-   work in line with open science and the FAIR principles?
:::

::: {.fragment}
Then Git & GitHub is something for you!

## What is Git?

![](images/git-logo.jpg)

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

-    VCS = Version Control Software.
-    Free and open-source.
-    Original Domain: Software Development.
-    Nowadays Git is being 'repurposed' beyond software development. 

:::

## What is GitHub?

![](images/github-logo.png)


::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

An online repository, based on Git software, for:

-   storing with version control
-   collaboration
-   publishing
-   project management
-   and more!

## Benefits of using Git & GitHub for researchers

![](images/git-and-github-combo.JPG)

---

## Benefits of using Git & GitHub for researchers (1/4)

Rigid structure of git helps manage project evolution.
Main/master copy on GitHub enables sane experimentation and collaboration.

![](images/git-structure.JPG)

---

## Benefits of using Git & GitHub for researchers (2/4)

Manage your code (and other files) down the very last details.
Experimentation is facilitated!

![](images/git-flow.JPG)

---

## Benefits of using Git & GitHub for researchers (3/4)

Version Control & Project History.
Like track changes in your Word document, which is also backed up on OneDrive - but BETTER!

![](images/project-history.jpg)

---

## Benefits of using Git & GitHub (4/4)

The software & platform is built to facilitate for Collaboration.

---

## Benefits of using Git & GitHub for researchers

In short:

-    Free and open-source
-    Efficient
-    Transparent
-    Reliable
-    Backups and Version Control
-    Collaboration
-    Sharing and Reuse

## The Git & GitHub Dream

![](images/researcher-git-workflow.JPG)

---

## A GitHub Repository

Git takes snapshots of all the files in a folder.
This folder is called a repository or repo.

Here's the same repository, but locally on our computer.

## How do I get started with Git? 

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

-    Command Line
-    [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/){preview-link="true"}
-    [RStudio integration](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html){preview-link="true"}
-    [Pycharm integration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/set-up-a-git-repository.html){preview-link="true"}
-    many more!

The simplest starting point, however, is GitHub in the web browser!

## Exercise!

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 4em"}

Check out [https://skills.github.com/](https://skills.github.com/){preview-link="true"}

You can try out any of the exercises, we do have some recommendations based on today's presentation:

-   For beginners, the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) exercise is a nice start. 
    You'll make a short Markdown file you can use as your profile README and learn about repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests while doing so!

-   For experienced users, the [Hello GitHub Actions](https://github.com/skills/hello-github-actions) exercise is a great introduction to the topic.

## GitHub Actions

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

-    Free service
-    Perform tasks on the servers of GitHub
-    Events/scheduled times

:::

## Usage

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

-    Testing
-    CI/CD
-    Packaging
-    Generating documentation
-    Pages, parsing documents, documentation

## Terminology{.smaller}

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

### Workflow
A workflow is one (or a set of) **job(s)** that are defined in a script (YAML file) and triggered by **events**
<br/>
<br/>

### Jobs
A job is a set of steps in a workflow that execute on the same **runner** (or server). Each step is either a shell script that will be executed, or an **action** that will be run. Steps are executed in order and are dependent on each other.

:::

## Terminology{.smaller}

::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

### Event
An event is a specific activity in a repository that triggers a workflow run. For example, activity can originate from GitHub when someone creates a pull request, opens an issue, or pushes a commit to a repository. You can also trigger a workflow run on a schedule  
<br/>
<br/>

### Runner
A runner is a server that runs your workflows when they're triggered. Each runner can run a single job at a time. GitHub provides Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS runners to run your workflows; each workflow run executes in a fresh, newly-provisioned virtual machine.

## Terminology{.smaller}

<br/>

### Action

An action is a custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex but frequently repeated task. Use an action to help reduce the amount of repetitive code that you write in your workflow files.
<br/>
<br/>

```
name: learn-github-actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
```
