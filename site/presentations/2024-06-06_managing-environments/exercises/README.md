# Using virtual environments
Virtual environments are very useful in order to avoid breaking dependencies across projects and improve reusability of your code. Multiple options are available in for each language and for each purpose. For this session, we will focus on the most commonly used solutions in Python and R: Venv, Renv, Conda, Docker and chroot.

## [Venv for Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (beginner)

## [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (beginner)

## [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and [chroot](https://www.howtogeek.com/441534/how-to-use-the-chroot-command-on-linux/Â ) (advanced)
