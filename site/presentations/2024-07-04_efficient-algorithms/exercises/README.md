## Clone Repository
[Repository](https://github.com/LukasvdWiel/algorithmsInspiredByNature/)

`git clone https://github.com/LukasvdWiel/algorithmsInspiredByNature.git`

Or download the repository as `.zip`

## Install General Mapping Tools
[Installation instruction](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/install.html#)

### For Windows
[Installation instruction](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/install.html#windows)
The recommended way is to use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux for doing the exercises.
If you need help setting this up, just raise your hand!

## Run code

Using the terminal, navigate to the cloned repository and make sure the branch is on `master`.
Got to the `examples` folder and for each of the two examples, use the instructions below to run the model.

### Fortran
`make release`

### Python
`make python`

Don't be afraid to ask for help if you have difficulty starting your terminal or running the code.

## Change model parameters
- Inspect the created plots. Is the final solution any good? 
- Rename the plots before starting a new run
- Open the Fortran or Python code and change some parameters (the section where the parameters are set is indicated in the beginning of the script) and see if you can get a better solution and/or a faster convergence to a good solution.
