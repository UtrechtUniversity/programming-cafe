Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated. (Wikipedia) Johan Hidding (eScienceCenter) is passionate about literate programming and developed a package that helps you write Literate Programs in Markdown.
