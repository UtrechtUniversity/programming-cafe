Fast DataFrames in Python

In this edition of the Programming Cafe, Raoul Schram introduced us to [Polars](https://pola.rs/). Polars is a library for dataframes that has been described as _blazingly fast_ ðŸ’¨ and _lightning-fast_ âš¡.  

We learnt about how Polars can be used in Python, plus how it stacks up against other popular dataframe libraries.
