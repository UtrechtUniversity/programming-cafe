We discussed the use of Git and GitHub during the first edition of the programming cafe.

Check out the slide below and do some [exercises](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/programming-cafe/exercises/git-and-github/git-and-github.md) to get started.

The UU GitHub page can be found [here](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity).
