You can do this using software like R. The files you need are named cats_uk.csv and cats_uk_reference.csv.\nView the Data: After reading the data, use a tool or function (like the View function in R) to visually inspect the contents of both data files. This step helps you understand what’s in the data.\nLoad Libraries: Make sure you have certain software libraries installed and loaded. These libraries include dplyr, move, moveVis, maptools, magrittr, and ggplot2. They provide tools for data manipulation and visualization.\nCombine and Filter Data: Use the dplyr library to combine the data from the two CSV files based on a common column called “tag_id.” After combining, filter the data to select only specific cat names like “Bear,” “Coco,” etc.\nConvert Timestamps: Convert the timestamps in the filtered data from a text format to a date-time format. This makes it easier to work with time-based data.\nCreate a Move Object: Using the filtered and timestamp-converted data, create a “move object” that represents the movement of cats. This object specifies the columns for longitude, latitude, time, and track ID.\nAlign Data: Adjust the timestamps in the move object to align them at a specific resolution, such as daily intervals. This step aggregates the data for each day.\nGenerate Map Frames: Create map frames to visualize cat movements. You can customize these frames by adding things like labels, a north arrow, and a scale bar.\nAdd Text: Include text on the map frames, such as a Twitter handle, at a specific location.\nPreview a Frame: Optionally, you can preview one of the map frames to see how it looks.\nGenerate an Animation: Finally, use a function or tool (like animate_frames) to turn the map frames into an animated GIF. This GIF will show the movements of the selected cats over time."

High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms provide compute power that might help to speed up your calculations or to increase your problem size (e.g. simulations at finer resolution, or exploring more parameter combinations). In this Programming Cafe Lukas van de Wiel, scientific programmer in Earth Sciences, will introduce us in the concepts of writing parallel code for HPC. As always we will prepare some hands on exercises so you can practice writing some parallel code yourself!\n\n Add April edition to calendar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Cafe May 2024\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 2nd May\nTime: 15:00-17:00\nLocation: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, University Library (Utrecht Science Park)\nDemo/Presentation: tbd\n\n Add May edition to calendar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Cafe June 2024 (@Faculty of Science)\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 6th June\nTime: 15:00-17:00\nLocation: Buys Ballotgebouw 1.69, Utrecht Science Park\nDemo/Presentation: TBD\nThis edition is hosted at the faculty of Science, however everyone is welcome as always!\n\n Add June edition to calendar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Cafe July 2024\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 4th July\nTime: 15:00-17:00\nLocation: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, University Library (Utrecht Science Park)\nDemo/Presentation: tbd\n\n Add July edition to calendar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 7th March\nTime: 15:00-17:00\nLocation: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, University Library (Utrecht Science Park)\nDemo/Presentation: Creating your own Python and R packages (by Raoul Schram and Jelle Treep)\nIf you are working with Python and R, undoubtedly you will have used packages (e.g. numpy, pandas, ggplot2 or tidyr). But did you know you can create your own packages? And did you know that this is not so difficult and often a good idea? In this programming cafe we discuss what a package is, when and why it is a good idea to create a packages, how to create a package and some best practices when creating packages. We will also have small tutorials for creating a simple package in R and Python yourself in the second hour of the programming cafe and experts in the room to help you!\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 8th February\nTime: 15:00-17:00\nLocation: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, University Library (Utrecht Science Park)\nDemo/Presentation: Demo of the Julia Programming Language (by Emilia Jarochowska)\n\nJulia is a programming language designed for scientific applications. It’s an attractive free alternative to Matlab and for users trained in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) rather than software development: the syntax is close to mathematical notation and the development of libraries for high-performance scientific computation is very active. Compared to Python, Julia’s reproducible environments system is designed to be moved between platforms more smoothly and reduce compatibility issues. But the main focus of Julia is high performance; although it can be used interactively (as scripts), it can be as fast - occasionally faster - than compiled languages such as Fortran.\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 11th January\nTime: 15:00-17:00\nLocation: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, University Library (Utrecht Science Park)\nDemo/Presentation: Advanced Git (by Dawa Ometto)\n\nYou’ve started using git for version control but are still puzzled by things as rebasing, merge conflict resolution, and pull request workflows? Then this Programming Café is for you! We’ll help you practice with intermediate-to-advanced uses of git, and also showcase some less known but handy ways in which you can use git during your development process.\n\nBasic knowledge of git (e.g. cloning a repository and staging/committing your changes) is assumed for the audience of the presentation.\nFor beginners we have a set of suggested exercises (and helpers) to get started with Git and GitHub.\nFor more advanced users, we may also delve into some of git’s “plumbing” to help you understand just what is going on when you type “git commit”.\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 7th June\nTime: 15:00-17:00\nLocation: Living Lab, University Library (Utrecht Science Park)\nDemo/Presentation: Literate Programming Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.

But did you know you can create your own packages? And did you know that this is not so difficult and often a good idea? In this programming cafe we discuss what a package is, when and why it is a good idea to create a packages, how to create a package and some best practices when creating packages. We will also have small tutorials for creating a simple package in R and Python yourself in the second hour of the programming cafe and experts in the room to help you!\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 8th February\nTime: 15:00-17:00\nLocation: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, University Library (Utrecht Science Park)\nDemo/Presentation: Demo of the Julia Programming Language (by Emilia Jarochowska)\n\nJulia is a programming language designed for scientific applications. It’s an attractive free alternative to Matlab and for users trained in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) rather than software development: the syntax is close to mathematical notation and the development of libraries for high-performance scientific computation is very active. Compared to Python, Julia’s reproducible environments system is designed to be moved between platforms more smoothly and reduce compatibility issues. But the main focus of Julia is high performance; although it can be used interactively (as scripts), it can be as fast - occasionally faster - than compiled languages such as Fortran.\n\n\n\n\nDate: Thursday, 11th January\nTime: 15:00-17:00\nLocation: Bucheliuszaal 6.18, University Library (Utrecht Science Park)\nDemo/Presentation: Advanced Git (by Dawa Ometto)\n\nYou’ve started using git for version control but are still puzzled by things as rebasing, merge conflict resolution, and pull request workflows?
