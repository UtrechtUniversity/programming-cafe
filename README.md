# Programming Cafe

The Programming Cafe is a community event organized every last wednesday of the month for everyone interested in writing code (R, Python, Matlab, Julia, etc.) at @UtrechtUniversity.

This repository is used for managing the website and presentations, exercises and other materials related to the Programming Cafe sessions.
